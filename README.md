# FEN Notation

FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) is a standard notation used to represent a particular chessboard position. It provides a concise and human-readable way to describe the placement of chess pieces on the board, as well as other important information about the position. Here's how FEN notation works:

<br>
Piece Placement (8 ranks): This field represents the positions of the pieces on the board. Each rank is represented by a series of characters, where:
<br>
K represents a white king.
Q represents a white queen.
R represents a white rook.
B represents a white bishop.
N represents a white knight.
P represents a white pawn.
k represents a black king.
q represents a black queen.
r represents a black rook.
b represents a black bishop.
n represents a black knight.
p represents a black pawn.
Digits (1-8) represent empty squares, with the number indicating the count of consecutive empty squares.
